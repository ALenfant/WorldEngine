WorldEngine
===========
Presentation
------------
This is a landscape paging engine for Truevision3D. It allows you to create vast landcapes by using smaller landscapes created dynamically.
It is optimized whenever possible (eg. using LinkedLists instead of ArrayLists when faster, using Priority Queue in order to compute nearer Landscapes, ...)

Features
--------
* Landscape tiling
* Landscape heightmap loading on the fly
* Landscape splatting (not working properly)

ToDo
----
* BugFixes (sometimes, problems detecting current landscape's height)
* Fix heightmap loading by array
* Avatar for the user
* Better object oriented design?
* ...lots of things I can't remember

Want to help?
-------------
I'm in need of other people to help me improving this engine !
What you can help me with :
* Reporting issues with the engine
* Helping me fix them
* Optimizing the hell out of the engine (I want it to be as lightweight as possible in order to be able to use it in a *real* game)
* Adding new features ! If you can help witht the ToDo or have any ideas to improve the engine, please don't hesitate to !
